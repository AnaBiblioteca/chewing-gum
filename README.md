My chewing-gum repository to test this

I suppose I should write something really brainy, like "this is my secret to give to the humans" or similar howeverit is impossible such a thing. It might be that the secret it is just an uncodable code, created not by a creator if not but a copy of him. Copies cannot create, but neither creators, they just create, waiting for their things to be interpretated, and luckily be taken in the correct direction they created the thing.
